# Selecting the right Classification Model

We are looking at a banking dataset for a Portuguese Bank to see if marketing campaigns would lead to a customer agreeing to open a Term Deposit. We would like to know what Classification Model would work best for this purpose.

We are looking a quite unbalanced dataset where there are very few records with positive classe compared to the negative class.
